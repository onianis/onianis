Hi. <br>
I am __Shota Oniani__. An AI Security Engineer in the works.<br>
Right now, I am working through my Computer Science degree at the University of Tübingen. <br>
I devise and build field-relevant projects to demonstrate the abilities I gain on my own.

We live in turbulent, yet exciting times. <br>
The least we can do is make sure that the emerging systems others are creating are secure and trustworthy.
